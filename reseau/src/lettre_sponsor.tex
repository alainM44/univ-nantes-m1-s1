\opening{Dear Mister JP.Pernault,}



My name is Maragarette de Chambron, secretary of the Save and Protect Our Children.Our association try (with god's help) to fight against video games.
This phenomenon wich every day perverts young boys and girls.

First of all, I would like to say to you how I love all your TF1 show and how I find you handsome on my tv at one o'clock.
However my letter's goals are the following ones : 
S.P.O.C propose to you an report subjet wich will definitely interest you. Indeed, we organize a big conference the 29th and the 30th of June in Nice. 
Doctor Scharchtzenberg (an international specialist), Brigitte Bardot and Bernadette Chirac (one of close freinds) will be present.
It would be very nice of you if you send a report team. They will be take in charge during two days with all the the facilities they would need.

One the ohter hand,  I wrote few days ago a letter to your administration for ask to them their sponsoring.
Could you use your influence ? Madam Chirac told me that your are usually sensitive to this type of noble and piety cause.

Thanks a lot Mister Pernault for your attention.

 
\closing{Yours Sincerly,}
